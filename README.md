This is a text to morse converter. By default it helps with the English alphabet, but you can specify a different alphabet along with its Morse code equivalents for this purpose. To use it, just turn on the program and enter a word, sentence or any text of your choice. Your input text will create a string of dots (which indicate a short signal) and dashes (which indicate a long signal).
